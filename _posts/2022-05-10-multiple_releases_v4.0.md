The old [comms_champion](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion) repository has been deprecated.
Its contents have been split into two separate repositories:

* [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) - See release notes of [v4.0](https://github.com/commschamp/comms/releases/tag/v4.0).
* [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt) - See release notes of [v4.0](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt/releases/tag/v4.0)

The [CommsDSL](https://github.com/commschamp/CommsDSL-Specification) has also been updated, see release notes of [v4.0](https://github.com/commschamp/CommsDSL-Specification/releases/tag/v4.0).

The [commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl) has also been released with version [v4.0](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl/releases/tag/v4.0). The important update 
is that the generated code requires new [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) as well as [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt) instead
of old [comms_champion](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion).

Updates to the [tutorial](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tutorial) as well as [examples](https://commschamp.github.io/examples/) are soon to follow.
