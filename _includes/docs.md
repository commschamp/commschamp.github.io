# Mastering Protocol Definition

1. Go thoroughly through the official [tutorials](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tutorial).
   They will introduce the concepts of the [CommsDSL](https://github.com/commschamp/CommsDSL-Specification)
   schema, [commsdsl2comms](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl) code generation,
   and interoperability with the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms).

2. Read through the online [CommsDSL Specification](https://commschamp.github.io/commsdsl_spec) to
   understand full capabilities of the schema definition language.

3. Read through the [COMMS library documentation](https://commschamp.github.io/comms_doc) to
   properly understand the code generated by the [commsdsl2comms](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl).
   It contains two major tutorial pages:

   - [How to Use Defined Custom Protocol](https://commschamp.github.io/comms_doc/page_use_prot.html) -
     it explains how to customize the protocol definition for the end application needs and
     how to integrate the protocol definition into the
     application business logic.
   - [How to Define New Custom Protocol](https://commschamp.github.io/comms_doc/page_define_prot.html) -
     it explains how to define custom communication protocol
     from scratch and can be very useful when it comes to implementing custom code when the generated
     code is incomplete and/or incorrect.

4. Read through the [Manual of commsdsl2comms](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl/blob/master/doc/Manual_commsdsl2comms.md),
   especially to understand custom code injection functionality.

5. Read through the [Generated Project Walkthrough](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl/blob/master/doc/GeneratedProjectWalkthrough.md)
   to understand the structure of the generated code.

6. Read through the [Protocol Definition Debugging Tips](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl/blob/master/doc/DebugProtocolDef.md) to
   better understand how to debug unexpected protocol definition behaviour.


# Mastering CommsChampion Tools

1. Read through the [How to Use CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt/wiki/How-to-Use-CommsChampion-Tools)
   wiki page to understand what they are and how to use them.

2. Read through the project's [README.md](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt) and the
   [build instructions](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build)
   in particular.

3. Read the [Visual Protocol Analysis](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl/blob/master/doc/VisualProtocolAnalysis.md)
   documentation page to understand how to generate the code and build the
   protocol plugin for the [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt).

4. Read the [Manual of commsdsl2tools_qt](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl/blob/master/doc/Manual_commsdsl2tools_qt.md).

5. Read the relevant [doxygen documentation](https://commschamp.github.io/cc_tools_qt_doc/) to
   understand how to develop extra plugins.
